// #554 gate false-positive telemetry: is the gate PRECISE? This is the evidence a maintainer needs before
// promoting a gate from advisory to block.
//
// MEASUREMENT only — like the #543 outcome-calibration service it NEVER auto-adjusts a gate or score (that
// would change what blocks live PRs; an owner-review decision). It only records + aggregates.
//
// A gate-block is a FALSE POSITIVE when the gate blocked a PR that turned out to be mergeable: the PR was
// blocked and later MERGED anyway. Per gate type (each blocker `code` that fired) we report blocked count,
// blocked-then-merged count, the count maintainers OVERRODE (the strongest false-positive signal — a human
// explicitly judged the block wrong), and a false-positive rate (blocked-then-merged / blocked), null below a
// min sample so a noisy rate is never reported. Inputs already exist: the gate_outcomes ledger (#554, this
// PR) records each block, and closed/merged PRs are retained on the PR row, so terminalOutcome resolves the
// same way outcome-calibration's does.
//
// Privacy: the report carries repo full name + PR-derived counts + gate-type codes ONLY — no actor logins, no
// trust/reward/credibility numbers. Internal/maintainer-authenticated; never publicly exposed.
