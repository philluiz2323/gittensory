// Public "proof of power" stats (#1059) — a small, public-safe aggregate of what gittensory's REVIEW SYSTEM has
// done, powering the above-the-fold homepage counter. Flag-gated by GITTENSORY_PUBLIC_STATS (default OFF): when
// off the public endpoint 404s, so the deploy is byte-identical to today until the flag is deliberately set.
//
// REALTIME: queries the live tables directly (no rollup/cron) so a new review shows up within the 60s HTTP cache
// window — single source of truth, always current. The source is review_targets (one row per PR, scoped to the
// repos the review system handles: gittensory, awesome-claude, metagraphed) with the terminal review DISPOSITION
// in `status`. This is NOT the broader pull_requests / recent_merged_pull_requests mining caches.
//
// DISPOSITIONS (terminal): merged / closed = gittensory auto-actioned; commented = reviewed + advised, deferred
// to a maintainer; manual = escalated to a maintainer; ignored = skipped (drafts/bots/excluded); error = failed.
//   reviewed   = merged + closed + commented + manual   (PRs it actually reviewed; excludes ignored + error)
//   filteredPct = (reviewed - merged) / reviewed         (share resolved WITHOUT a merge — noise kept off humans)
//   accuracyPct = 1 - reversed / (merged + closed)       (reversal-grounded; reversed from review_audit)
//   minutesSaved = reviewed * MINUTES_SAVED_PER_PR        (estimated maintainer review time saved)
//
// PRIVACY: counts only — no PR content, authors, scores, or reward internals. Safe to serve publicly.
