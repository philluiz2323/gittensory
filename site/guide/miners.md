# For Miners

Gittensory helps miners choose work with evidence: lane fit, score blockers, queue pressure, local diff quality, realistic scenario projections, and deterministic base-agent next actions.

## Agent Planning Flow

Run this when you are deciding what to work on next:

```sh
gittensory-mcp agent plan --login YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN --json
```

For a specific repo:

```sh
gittensory-mcp agent plan --login YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN --repo owner/repo --json
```

The agent returns ranked actions with why they matter, what is blocked, how they affect scoreability, how they affect maintainer review load, and when to rerun. It is copilot-only: it does not edit code, open PRs, post comments, close, merge, or label.

## Branch Analysis Flow

Run this before opening or updating a PR:

```sh
gittensory-mcp analyze-branch --login YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN --json
```

The response explains:

- repo lane and role context
- current scoreability and blocker gates
- open PR pressure and cleanup-first guidance
- duplicate or WIP collision risk
- stale-base warnings when the local diff looks inflated
- validation evidence from changed test paths and command summaries
- a public-safe PR packet for maintainers

## Scenario Flags

When approved PRs are expected to land soon, pass the assumption explicitly:

```sh
gittensory-mcp analyze-branch --login YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN \
  --pending-merged-prs 3 \
  --expected-open-prs 0 \
  --projected-credibility 0.8 \
  --scenario-note "approved PRs expected to merge" \
  --json
```

Gittensory labels this as a user-supplied scenario. It separates the current effective score, the underlying potential score, and what changes if open-PR and credibility gates clear.

Local branch analysis sends metadata only. File contents are not uploaded.

## Preflight

```sh
gittensory-mcp preflight --login YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN --json
```

Use preflight when you need a quick answer on linked issues, tests, duplicate risk, lane fit, and maintainer review friction.

## PR Packet

```sh
gittensory-mcp agent packet --login YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN --repo owner/repo --json
```

This prepares a public-safe maintainer packet from metadata only. Private scoreability and reward/risk context stays out of the packet.

## When To Use Gittensory

- before opening a PR
- after PR approvals but before rerunning score projections
- when deciding whether to clean up existing PRs first
- when choosing between direct PR work and issue-discovery flow
- when you want an agent to rank the next Gittensor action before you spend time coding

Gittensory does not promise payouts. It explains scoreability, risk, and what actions make the work more likely to be reviewable and scoreable.
